# LMM-AI — Language-to-Motion Model  
**By [Deprecated](https://github.com/DeprecatedForever)**

LMM (Language-to-Motion Model) is an AI system that translates language — speech, tone, and expression — into accurate, expressive full-body motion. Designed for real-time interaction, LMM gives 3D characters the ability to move naturally and intelligently while speaking, reacting, or performing actions, without pre-baked animations.

##  Key Features

- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Motion:** Converts spoken language into synchronized body movement
- 🧠 **Context-Aware:** Understands gestures, tone, and intention (e.g., asking, reacting, feeling)
- 🕹️ **Real-Time or Prompt-Based:** Use for live gameplay or offline animation generation
- 🎮 **Game & VR-Ready:** Built for integration with engines and platforms
- 🧩 **Modular Bone System:** Works with any model using standard bone naming (`L_PointerF`, `R_Leg`, etc.)
- 🔁 **Inverse Kinematics Support:** Smooth physical realism through IK-based control
- 🧬 **Future Expansion:** Supports physical awareness, emotion, and eventually animals (e.g., tail, ears)
