# LMM-AI — Language-to-Motion Model

Created by Deprecated

LMM (Language-to-Motion Model) is an AI system designed to translate language — spoken or written — into realistic, expressive body motion in real time. It enables 3D models to move naturally while speaking, reacting, or performing, without relying on pre-animated sequences.

 What It Does

Understands words, tone, and intent

Maps these to full-body motion using inverse kinematics (IK)

Reacts in real time or generates motion sequences from prompts

Works with any 3D model using a standardized bone naming convention


 Main Use Cases

Real-time game character animation

VR avatars with natural gestures

AI NPCs that speak and move dynamically

Blender/Maya projects without hand-animating motions

Future potential for animals, robots, and expressive agents
